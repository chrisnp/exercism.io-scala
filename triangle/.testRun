[info] TriangleTest:
[info] - equilateral - true if all sides are equal
[info] - equilateral - false if any side is unequal
[info] - equilateral - false if no sides are equal
[info] - equilateral - All zero sides are illegal, so the triangle is not equilateral
[info] - equilateral - sides may be floats
[info] - isosceles - true if last two sides are equal
[info] - isosceles - true if first two sides are equal
[info] - isosceles - true if first and last sides are equal
[info] - isosceles - equilateral triangles are also isosceles
[info] - isosceles - false if no sides are equal
[info] - isosceles - Sides that violate triangle inequality are not isosceles, even if two are equal
[info] - isosceles - sides may be floats
[info] - scalene - true if no sides are equal
[info] - scalene - false if all sides are equal
[info] - scalene - false if two sides are equal
[info] - scalene - Sides that violate triangle inequality are not scalene, even if they are all different
[info] - scalene - sides may be floats
